# VGTKSourceView
A language specification for V using GTKSourceView. Enabling syntax highlighting for GTK based text editors/IDEs.

## Installation
If you're running Gnome 3, simply copy/move `v.lang` into the `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/v.lang` directory.
Or if you're running Gnome 4: `/usr/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/v.lang`

### Note:
There is a glob/file extension conflict as both `V` and `Verilog` share the same file extension.
